# elektrischvervoer

This is a list in XML of all the electric charging stations in Amsterdam

There are no Issues at present with this list, it can be used as a static input to the MMP

# metadata_realtime_verkeersdata

Description and sample code for the real time traffic velocity on some main routes into and out of amsterdam

Issue 1
- Issue : it only has some routes and is based on gps points rather than street names whick makes it difficult to map onto openstreetmap or other mapping systems.
- However : At the Waag they have made a system to perform the mapping , this can be used to overcome this issue

Issue 2
- Issue : It only has a few routes thus if you turn onto a side street the infomation becomes un-interesting
- However : it could be used in a different way i.e. to correlate with other data for prediction

Alternative
- There are many alternatives which are more comprehensive but most of them are closed, for instance tomtom gets its data from the vodafone network and is fully comprehensive but closed
- Wares is crowdsourced but in our experience is quite comprehensive in amsterdam. All users feed back their position and speed.  It also asks for feedback if there is a traffic jam.
- Others exist but are too numerous to document, please feel free to add to this list
