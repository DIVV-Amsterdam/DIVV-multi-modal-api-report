DIVV-multi-modal-api-report
===========================

This is the repository for the project "Towards a Multimodal API", executed
by 
[Glimworm IT BV](http://glimworm.com/),
[Braxwell.com](http://www.braxwell.com/) and 
[Solid Links](http://solidlinks.nl/) for the 
Department of Infrastructure, Traffic and Transportation (DIVV) of the city
of Amsterdam.


Background of this project
--------------------------
With their Open Data motto “We provide the data, you build the apps”,
DIVV (Dienst Infrastructuur, Verkeer en Vervoer) of the city of Amsterdam
defined that apps should be developed by the open market.
The municipality is dedicated to the provision of Open Data.
 
For some time there is a topic within the transport domain of the 
municipality that has specific political attention: the multimodal app. 
Until now, there have been no strong initiatives from the open market in 
this direction. To encourage such developments, DIVV wants to examine the 
development of a multimodal API. By bringing data from different modes of 
transport together the development of such apps are much easier.

The goal of this project was to investigate the potential for DIVV to achieve 
a multimodal API with the current set of data. To know what challenges and 
issues need to overcome, we’ve built a proof of concept for a multimodal API.


What can you find here on Github?
---------------------------------
In our [Wiki](../../wiki/) you can find a detailed look at the requirements we 
set for the multimodal travel API, use cases we defined, an overview of 
required and available data, and more.

In the [PHP code](php/) you can find our proof of concept implementation of 
the API with a small web frontend. Most individual directories have further
README files with more details.
