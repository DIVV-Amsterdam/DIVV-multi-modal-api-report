** Code
** Documentation

==Report==
Should be a max. 10 page clear and practical document.
Possible title "<i>Roadplan to provide the optimal open data for developers to build the multimodal app</i>"

===Discussion===
In what language should this report be? I alway assumed English, but we might consider Dutch.
For the code and documentation this is no discussion, but if the main target group for this document besides IVV is the Dutch (local) government and public transport companies, a Dutch report may be more powerfull

=== Targets ===
* For developers:
** Focus on sharing the knowledge gained in the process
** How easy it is or isn’t to connect to the data
*	For data providers: 
** Advice on every level and every aspect where and how data should be approved + what it means for developer. “If prediction is not good, don’t use it.”
* For IVV:
** What Open Data do we need to open/facilitate for car + bike. (Parkeerkansen, etc.)
** What is it going to cost to build the actual API (Basic, Plus, All, etc) both in money and time
